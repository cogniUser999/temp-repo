What is the difference between findElement() and findElements() ?

--> The submit() function is applicable only for <form> and makes handling of form easier. 
    It can be used with any element inside a form. 
    The click() is only applicable to buttons with type submit in a form.

    The submit() function shall wait for the page to load however the click() waits only if any explicit wait condition is provided. 
    If a form has a submit of type button, the submit() method cannot be used. 
    Also, if a button is outside <form>, then submit() will not work.

4)Javascript Executor Usage

Explain any 5 names of exceptions in selenium?

When to use javaScript Executor?
--> JavaScript executor is used when id,name,xpath is not working with webelements then we can try it out with javaScript
    executor.

what is diffn between navigate().to(URL) and driver.get()?

  -Build

Diiferent types of pop-up:
1) Web popups- The icon or messages that are generated by your webPage.
2) System popups - pop-ups that we have to upload images or files from your system.

Diffrerence between popups and alerts?
Scalar command?

How to perform drag and drop with the slider?

For finding the total number of option from dropdown then by using select class the (getOptions()) is used and return type
is List<WebElement>.

Alert is not a webElement.

For handeling the alerts we have to use (driver.switchTo().alert()) this command will switch operation to alert.

To close the alert window by Ok or for Accepting alert window we use alertWindow.accept().

To close the alert window by Cancle or for Declining alert window we use alertWindow.dismiss().

To perform any action on iframe/frame we have to switch to that frame the syntax is 
--> driver.switchTo().frame(id/class/webElement/index);

If we have to handle multiple frames then after performing any action on particular frame we have to switch to deafalut 
content of page. Syntax :  driver.switchTo().defaultContent();

iFrame - External page that is embbeded into the current webpage.

If we have to switch from 1 window to another window then we have get the window id by --> driver.getWindowHandle()
After that if we have to switch to particular window then we use --> driver.switchTo().window(windowID);

In automation with automate with only valid inputs.

difference between SDLC and STLC?

White box testing also known as glass-box testing, structural-box testing,unit-testing.

To perform mouse events we have to use Actions class.

To perform right click on webpage use -> act.contextClick(WebELement).perform();

To perform right click on webpage use -> act.dragAndDrop(WebELement).perform();

To perform right click on webpage use -> act.double-Click(WebELement).perform();

To find the current location of webelement i.e. (x,y) cordinate er use --> getLocation() --> slider.getLocation();

To perform action on slider we use --> dragAndDropBy(webelement,x-co,y-co) --> act.dragAndDropBy(slider,100,250);

If we do not want perform any mouse immeditely then we use build() method to just capture that element and return type is
Action interface and the use method perform() on that element.

The element location will be changed based on the size of browser window.

What is test plan?
--> It is always include what is to be done in the future.
  1)Test plan
  2) Test Scope
  3)Test Schedule
  4)Entry criteria- Smoke testing- Always perform testing of Main feature of application.(Check if software is testable).
  5) Exit criteria- Acceptance Testing- 

Jira is a project management tool that facilitate developent team, testing team and business team also.

Test managemet tools- only use by testing team.

STCM/Reports - 

RTM(Requirment Tracebility Matrix) = CRM(Cross Tracebility Matrix) = TM(Tracebility Matrix).

Prerequisites = Precondition.

Severity- importance of test case.
Priority- importance of test the project or module.

Low- severity and High-severity--> Spelling in the gmail application is missing. 

Difference between defect,error,Bug,Failure.

Defect- Any human made mistake.
Error- (Error=Bug) [Expected != Actual]

Defect always leads to Error or bug and this leads to failure.


Types of Testing
diff b/w white and black box
types of blackbox testing
diff b/w smoke and sanity
	|-> smoke - main content
	|-> sanity - high level test of main features on new integrations
